# FLAME GPU

FLAME GPU (Flexible Large-scale Agent Modelling Environment for Graphics Processing Units) is a GPU accelerated simulator for domain independent complex systems simulations.

## FLAME GPU 2.x

FLAME GPU 2 is complete re-write of the existing library offering greater flexibility, an improved interface for agent scripting and better research software engineering, with CUDA/C++ and Python interfaces.

**FLAME GPU 2 is currently in an pre-release (alpha) state**. For more information, see the [FLAMEGPU2 Readme](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2#readme).
